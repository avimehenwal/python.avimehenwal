features:
- title: 👨‍👩‍👧 General purpose programming
  details: Write short automation scritps to complicated CLI tools or web-apps. Use any programming paradigm you are familiar with. Everything is possible
- title: 🛠 Both compiled and interpreted
  details: Depends on implementation. CPython implementation is first compiled to bytecode by PVM and then sent for execution by CPU. REPL uses interpretor to execute python
- title: 🖥 Cross - Platform
  details: Write once and use everywhere. Great cross platform portability, run same softwares on your machines and then deploy them cloud servers

::: theorem

### :woman_scientist:  Principle of Science and Engineering  :man_scientist:

***"Try to do ==good science== rather than :money_mouth_face: popular science"***

#### Liberal Education

***"Learn something about everything and everything about something"***

### :innocent:  Zen of Python  :innocent:

Beautiful is better than ugly.

Explicit is better than implicit.

Simple is better than complex.

Complex is better than complicated.

Flat is better than nested.

Sparse is better than dense.

Readability counts.

Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

Although practicality beats purity.

Errors should never pass silently.

Unless explicitly silenced.

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

Now is better than never.

Although never is often better than *right* now.

If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
