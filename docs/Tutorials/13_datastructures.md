In computer science, a [data structure] is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

Not to be confused with [data type]. DS serves as baises of [ADT]

Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications,
and some are highly specialized to specific tasks.

<Badge type="tip" vertical="middle" text="For Example," /> relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval, while ==compiler implementations== usually use hash tables to look up identifiers.

## Algorithms

> Maths is the study of the fromal systems

Solutions to some general problems. Problem solving

How to measure if a algorith is better than another?

Enter [Time Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity), estimated by counting the
number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm

$$Time \, Complexity \neq Execution \, Time$$

Since an algorithm's running time may vary among different inputs of the same size, one commonly considers the worst-case time complexity, which is the maximum amount of time required for inputs of a given size

This is further simplified by using the [Asymptotic_analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_analysis)
which is approximating fucntional vales for very large value of fn input

Commonly represented as [Big-O Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)
