::: warning django migrations
You have 18 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.
Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.

Migrations are Djangoâ€™s way of propagating changes you make to your models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into your database schema.

start development server`python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver`

Django tracks which ones are applied using a special table in your database called **django_migrations**) and runs them against your database - essentially, synchronizing the changes you made to your models with the schema in the database.

[what is refential CASCADE in django models?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38388423/what-does-on-delete-do-on-django-models)

: When the referenced object is deleted, also delete the objects that have references to it (when you remove a blog post for instance, you might want to delete comments as well). SQL equivalent: CASCADE.
