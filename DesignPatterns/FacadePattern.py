"""
1. Facade is an abstraction layer implemented over an existing complex system.The Facade (also known as Fa√ßade) design pattern helps us to hide the internal complexity of our systems and expose only what is necessary to the client through a simplified interface [Eckel08, page 209].

2. Provides a single, simple entry point to a complex system. By introducing Facade, the client code can use a system by simply calling a single method/function. At the same time, the internal system does not lose any functionality. It just encapsulates it

3. Facade is also useful if you have more than one layer in your system. You can introduce one Facade entry point per layer, and let all layers communicate with each other through their Facades. That promotes loose coupling and keeps the layers as independent as possible

4. Examples, customer service department of a bank, or a company, and the keys that we use to turn a vehicle on
